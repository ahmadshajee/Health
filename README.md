# Healthcare Management System

A comprehensive healthcare management system built with React.js and Node.js, featuring prescription management, patient records, and medical history tracking.

## 🚀 Overview

This system provides a complete healthcare management solution where doctors can manage patients, create digital prescriptions with QR codes, track medical history, and patients can access their medical records securely.

## 🚀 Features

### For Doctors
- **Patient Management**: View and manage patients with comprehensive medical records
- **Prescription System**: Create, manage, and track prescriptions with QR codes
- **Medical History**: Access detailed patient medical history and allergies
- **Prescription Analytics**: Track active, completed, and total prescriptions per patient
- **PDF Generation**: Generate prescription PDFs with embedded QR codes for verification

### For Patients  
- **Profile Management**: Update personal and medical information
- **Prescription History**: View prescription history and current medications
- **Medical Records**: Access personal medical data and treatment history

### System Features
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **QR Code Integration**: QR codes embedded in prescription PDFs for verification
- **Email Notifications**: Automated email notifications for prescription updates
- **Responsive Design**: Modern Material-UI interface that works on all devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates across the application

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React with JavaScript/TypeScript
- Material UI for UI components
- Axios for API requests
- QR code display library

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- JWT for authentication
- Nodemailer for email notifications
- QR code generation
- JSON file-based data storage

## Workflow

1. Doctor logs in to the system
2. Doctor creates a digital prescription
3. Patient receives an email notification
4. Patient views/downloads the prescription
5. QR code verification for prescription authenticity

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Client Setup
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### Server Setup
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

### Environment Variables
- `MONGO_URI` (preferred) or `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: secret used to sign auth tokens
- `PORT`: optional, defaults to 5000
- `NODE_ENV`: set to `production` in hosted environments

The backend exposes `/health` for Render health checks and reports whether MongoDB is connected.

### Using MongoDB Atlas (Render / Production)
- Recommended: set `MONGO_URI` or `MONGODB_URI` as an environment variable in your host (Render, Heroku, etc.).
- If you cannot set environment variables, you may create a local file `server/config/mongo.json` with this shape (development only):

```json
{
  "MONGO_URI": "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
}
```

- A template is provided at `server/config/mongo.example.json`. Do **not** commit `server/config/mongo.json` — it is included in `.gitignore` for safety.
- After configuring the URI, restart the server — the app will use MongoDB instead of JSON files for persistent storage.

### Migrating existing JSON data into MongoDB
If you have existing users/prescriptions stored in `server/data/*.json` and want to import them into MongoDB Atlas:

1. Ensure `MONGO_URI` is set (or `server/config/mongo.json` exists).
2. From the `server` folder run:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

3. The script will upsert users by email and import prescriptions while attempting to resolve patient/doctor references. Inspect logs for any skipped records.  
4. After migration, verify documents in MongoDB Atlas and then you may remove or archive the JSON files (optional).

## Key Components

### Authentication
- **LoginForm**: Handles user authentication with email/password and role selection
- **RegisterForm**: Multi-step registration process with role-specific fields

### Prescriptions
- **PrescriptionForm**: For doctors to create new prescriptions with medication details
- **PrescriptionList**: For patients to view and download their prescriptions
- **QR Code Generation**: Secure verification of prescription authenticity
